# Android Basics with Compose

This repository contains my progress and projects completed as part of the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course.

## Course Overview

This is a self-paced, online course designed to teach the fundamentals of building Android apps using modern best practices. The primary focus is on using **Jetpack Compose**, the recommended toolkit for building native user interfaces in Android.

### What I'm Learning

*   **Kotlin Programming Fundamentals**: Starting with basic syntax, variables, and functions, progressing to conditionals, nullability, classes, objects, collections, lambdas, and coroutines.
*   **Jetpack Compose**: Building declarative UIs from the ground up, understanding composition and recomposition, managing state, handling user interactions (like button clicks), displaying lists and images, implementing animations, and applying Material Design principles.
*   **Android App Architecture**: Understanding the basics of Modern Android Development architecture, including the UI Layer, the Data Layer, and using patterns like Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF). Introduction to ViewModels for managing UI-related data and state.
*   **App Navigation**: Implementing navigation between different screens within an app using the Navigation component with Compose.
*   **State Management**: Effectively managing and updating UI state using concepts like `mutableStateOf`, `remember`, and `StateFlow`.
*   **Data Handling**:
    *   Fetching data from the internet using `Retrofit`.
    *   Displaying images from the internet using the `Coil` library.
    *   Storing data locally using `Room` persistence library for databases.
    *   Storing simple key-value pairs using `Preferences DataStore`.
*   **Concurrency**: Performing background tasks efficiently using Kotlin `Coroutines`.
*   **Background Processing**: Scheduling and managing background tasks that run even if the app is closed or the device restarts using `WorkManager`.
*   **UI Adaptability**: Building responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
*   **Testing**: Writing unit tests for functions and ViewModels, and performing accessibility testing.
*   **Interoperability**: Integrating Jetpack Compose with the traditional View system (XML-based UIs) and vice-versa.
*   **Tools & Best Practices**: Using Android Studio, understanding the Activity lifecycle, dependency injection concepts, using the debugger, and leveraging Android libraries (Jetpack).

### Methodologies and Libraries Used

*   **Programming Language**: Kotlin
*   **UI Toolkit**: Jetpack Compose
*   **UI Design**: Material Design 3
*   **App Architecture**: Modern Android App Architecture (UI Layer, Data Layer), Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)
*   **State Management**: `State`, `mutableStateOf`, `remember`, `ViewModel`, `StateFlow`
*   **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Component (for Compose)
*   **Networking**: Retrofit
*   **Image Loading**: Coil
*   **Asynchronous Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines, Flows
*   **Data Persistence**:
    *   Room (SQLite abstraction)
    *   Preferences DataStore
*   **Background Tasks**: WorkManager
*   **Testing**: JUnit, Truth (likely, based on common Android practices)
*   **Interoperability**: `AndroidView`, integrating Compose into Views and Views into Compose.
*   **Development Environment**: Android Studio
